## Traffic Accidents in the UK
- Investigating traffic accident seriousness in the UK and the variables that are more likely to lead to a car collision.
- This project is submitted as part of the CodeFirstGirls Data NanoDegree.

 ## Aims and Objectives
Annually, in the UK, there are approximately 150,000 people who are caught in a traffic accident. Every 16 minutes
someone is killed or seriously injured in the UK (Brake, 2022), and that can be any of us as a passenger or a driver. From
our own experiences with vehicles in the UK, we found it important to explore the factors that can lead to a traffic
accident and consider potential solutions to reducing the risk of them happening. Our project aims are:
- Discover the circumstances in which traffic accidents are more likely to happen.
- Produce an analysis and visualisation that will highlight the answers to our project objective questions.
- Provide an insightful view into the traffic accidents that happened in 2021 and offer recommendations to the UK
government in reducing the number of traffic accidents.

 The code is included in the **Project Code** folder:
 1. Jupyter notebooks (1. Data cleaning.ipynb, 2. Data analysis.ipynb, 3. Machine learning.ipynb)
 2. Cleaned data (road_accident_data_cleaned.csv)
 3. Raw data (RAW - Accident Road Casualty Statistics - 2021.csv, RAW - Casualty Road Casualty Statistics - 2021.csv, RAW - Vehicle Road Casualty Data - 2021.csv)

 ## Steps For Running The Project Code
1. Clone the git repo locally
2. Install the following packages via pip (or conda, depending on preference): <br>
- pandas, numpy, csv, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, functools, math, sklearn.cluster, folium, folium.plugins, geopy.geocoders, geopy.point, geopy.extra.rate_limiter, sklearn.model_selection, warnings, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.tree, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.svm, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.feature_selection, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn, sklearn.decomposition, imblearn.over_sampling, matplotlib
3. Open 1. Data cleaning.ipynb, 2. Data analysis.ipynb, 3. Machine learning.ipynb in jupyter notebook
4. Run the code
 Enjoy!
