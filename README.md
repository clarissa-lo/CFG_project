_This project is submitted as part of the CodeFirstGirls Data NanoDegree, to investigate traffic accident seriousness in the UK and the variables that are more likely to lead to a car collision._

 ## ☁️ Aims and Objectives
Annually, in the UK, there are approximately 150,000 people who are caught in a traffic accident. Every 16 minutes
someone is killed or seriously injured in the UK (Brake, 2022), and that can be any of us as a passenger or a driver. From
our own experiences with vehicles in the UK, we found it important to explore the factors that can lead to a traffic
accident and consider potential solutions to reducing the risk of them happening. Our project aims are:
- Discover the circumstances in which traffic accidents are more likely to happen.
- Produce an analysis and visualisation that will highlight the answers to our project objective questions.
- Provide an insightful view into the traffic accidents that happened in 2021 and offer recommendations to the UK
government in reducing the number of traffic accidents.
